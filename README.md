# Stone Duality in Lean

The first goal is to prove that the categories of Boolean algebras and of profinite spaces are dually equivalent. A "blueprint" of the proof is available [here](https://samvang.github.io/StoneDualityInLean/blueprint/). 

## Dependencies

* The [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) programming language and theorem prover
* [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/): a library of formalized mathematics
* [leanblueprint](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint): LaTeX package for making the blueprint.
