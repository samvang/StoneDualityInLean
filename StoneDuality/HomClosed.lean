    function space in a topological algebra.

/- Proof sketch of what is happening above:
  When x ∈ X, I write π_x for the x-coordinate projection map (X → Y) → Y.
  Note that the set in question can be written as
  g⁻¹ (Δ)
  where Δ is the diagonal in Y × Y, which is closed because Y is T2.
  g is the function (X → Y) → (Y × Y) defined by
  g(f) := (f (oX x₁ x₂), oY (f x₁) (f x₂)).
  And g is continuous because each component is:
  the first component is equal to π_x where x := oX x₁ x₂
  and the second component is the composite oY ∘ ⟨π_(x₁), π_(x₂)⟩.
  [NB: I had to do some hacking with currying oY, sometimes we want it to have type
  Y → Y → Y (like when we apply it below) and sometimes type Y × Y → Y (like when we reason about
  the diagonal as a closed subset of Y × Y). This can probably be improved.]
